🛠️ Key Features
	•	Shape: U-shaped bracket for joint flexibility and attachment.
	•	Base Holes:
	•	5 circular holes in the base.
	•	Each hole has a 5 mm diameter – intended for screws or bolts.
	•	Side Holes:
	•	2 lateral holes (1 on each arm) to allow for shaft mounting or pin connections.
	•	Fillets and rounded edges are applied to reduce stress concentration.
	•	Suitable for horizontal or vertical mounting depending on assembly orientation.

🧪 Suggested 3D Printing Material

Recommended: PETG

Why PETG?
	•	Stronger than PLA and easier to print than ABS.
	•	Good resistance to stress and environmental humidity.
	•	Suitable for mechanical parts under repeated load.
